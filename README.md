🌍 Digital Water Footprint Calculator
This project is a capstone project developed under the theme "Use of Digital Technology to Calculate Water Footprints for Daily Use Items."

💧 Overview

Water is a critical yet finite natural resource, and a large portion of its usage is hidden in the production of our daily items.
This project aims to build a digital tool that calculates the water footprint of everyday goods—such as food, clothing, and household products—by integrating reliable datasets, computational algorithms, and user-friendly interfaces.

✨ Key Features
📊 Calculates item-specific water footprints instead of generic totals.
🌐 Uses real-time or region-based datasets for improved accuracy.
🖼️ Visualizes results with easy-to-understand charts and graphs.
💡 Provides actionable tips for reducing personal water consumption.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React / Vue / HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js (Express)
Database: MySQL / JSON-based storage
Libraries & Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Chart.js / D3.js, VS Code

🎯 Objectives
Promote awareness of hidden water usage in daily life.
Encourage sustainable consumption habits.
Support data-driven decision-making for water conservation.

🚀 Expected Outcome
A fully functional digital water footprint calculator that empowers individuals and organizations to make sustainable choices through data insights.
